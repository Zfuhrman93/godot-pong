This is a clone of the game "Pong" as a part of a 10 game challenge I started to get me back on coding, learn game design as a hobby, as well as get practice in incorperating ChatGPT into my work flow. The project is made in Godot using GD Script, which is very similar to Python. I used ChatGPT when possible if I had any questions, a script I wanted to quickly generate, as well as suggestions on how to proceed with certain functions. All coding was however looked over by me prior to being implemented, and most needed mild to heavy editing to get working (ChatGPT has a cut off point of September 2022 for it's information, well before the release of the version of Godot I used, 4.1.1, so there were several instances where ChatGPT was unable to help as features had changed.)

There are a few tweeks I can make to improve the game, such as making the AI Paddle more smooth, but I will be moving on to the next game in the challenge atleast for now.

The .rar file contains the exe and pak file needed to play the game.

The Controls:

The sound effects used were downloaded from "FreeGameArt.org": https://opengameart.org/content/3-ping-pong-sounds-8-bit-style

The graphics (Backgrounds, Paddles, and Ball) were made in Asprite by me.
